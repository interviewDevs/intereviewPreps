# Welcome to Interview Prep Repo

This repo is to help friends and other IT professionals to solve company test interviews.
This is a public repository atm, but in the future I will move it to a website to be easy to navigate.

# Structure

The Repo will have the following structure: 

```markdown
├── JUNIOR LEVEL
│   ├── Backend
│   │   ├── Java

```

Having type of **ROLE LEVEL** as main folder.
The type of **ROLE** at the first child
The type of **LANGUAGE** at second child
The **Test name** as the third child
The content of this test inside in the format of the test language. sample: **test.java** for test in **java** 

## Test content headers

To help the search for the tests, please add comments at the test content as headers, following this format **(remember that comment tags changes on the language type used, some are with /, others with # and go on....)**
Javascript sample:
```markdown
// Test title: [HERE IS THE TEST NAME]
// Test completed: True (True for completed, False for incompleted, so we can complete this later)
// Company: [COMPANY WHERE THIS TEST WAS APPLIED]
```
